Clean & Analyze Social Media Data

This project demonstrates how to clean, explore, and analyze a simulated social media dataset using Python. The dataset contains posts from various categories (Tech, Sports, Fashion, Food, Travel) along with the number of likes each post received. The goal is to understand trends in engagement and identify which content resonates most with audiences.

Features

Data Simulation: Generate a synthetic dataset with categories, likes, and text content.

Data Exploration: Inspect dataset shape, missing values, and descriptive statistics.

Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize category distribution and likes trends.

Engagement Analysis: Identify top-performing categories and draw insights.

Recommendations: Suggest content strategies based on analysis results.
